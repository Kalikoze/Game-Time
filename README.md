Arrow keys control Player 1, and WASD keys control Player 2. 

If a player hits a boundary wall, the other player's trail, or its own trail, the other player will receive one point.

The first player to receive three points will win the round. Once a round is won by a player, the level will increase. Level increase will be shown on the interface and the speed will increase. The first player to win three rounds will be the winner of the game, and the interface will show the winner and game over.

At the end of the game, the user will be prompted to press the enter key to return to the initial game start screen.
